## How to Play:
---
Players navigate the snake using arrow keys or specified controls, guiding it to consume food items randomly placed within the game area. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making navigation more challenging. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries, and players can see their score.
